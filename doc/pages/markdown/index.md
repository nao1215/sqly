## What is sqly?

The `sqly` command is a command-line tool for executing SQL queries on CSV/TSV/LTSV/JSON files and Microsoft Excelâ„¢. `sqly` is written in Golang and supports cross-platform usage. Similar tools include [harelba/q](https://github.com/harelba/q), [dinedal/textql](https://github.com/dinedal/textql), [noborus/trdsql](https://github.com/noborus/trdsql), and [mithrandie/csvq](https://github.com/mithrandie/csvq).

One of the unique strengths of `sqly` is that it allows you to interactively build SQL queries using the `sqly shell`. You can interactively execute SQL with SQL completion and command history. Of course, you can also execute SQL without running the `sqly-shell`. Since `sqly` uses SQLite3 to execute SQL, the SQL syntax is equivalent to SQLite3.

The sqly project performs quality checks using GitHub Actions. The following items are checked in GitHub Actions:

- Whether it can be built
- Whether tests pass
- Whether auto-generated files are up-to-date
- Whether test coverage exceeds 83%
- Whether it passes multiple linters (e.g., whether it follows architectural rules, whether it has security measures, etc.)
